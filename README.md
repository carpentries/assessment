# The Carpentries Assessment

This repository contains assessment data, source code, and analyses for The Carpentries workshops and programmatic assessment.

[The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org) teach core computational and data skills to researchers. We also train instructors to teach workshops on computational skills. We value a culture of assessment, and consistently assess learner outcomes from workshops (short term),  programmatic efforts (instructor training), and the long-term impact we have on learners.

Assessment projects are led by Kari L. Jordan, Director of Assessment and Community Equity. The data, code and reports in this repository are publicly available under the CC-BY 4.0 license. The projects in this repository are open for comments/feedback and collaboration.

# Content
The repository currently contains assessment of the following:

+ [Workshops](https://carpentries.github.io/assessment/learner-assessment/): Evaluation of the impact we are having with our workshops teaching data and computational skills throughout our global community. Includes sub-folders with data, reports, and figures.
+ [Programs](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/tree/master/programmatic-assessment): Evaluation of The Carpentries Instructor Training post-workshop survey. Includes recommendations for changes to curriculum and general assessment of our instructor training program.

Additionally, the repository contains minutes from the [assessment-network](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/tree/master/assessment-network) meetings. This group collaborates and shares resources on assessment within the open source/research computing space.
