## Part 1: Introduction and Basics

### 1.1 Introduction
The goal of this handbook is to provide a basic introduction to the purpose of assessment and how to do it. 

It is specifically focused on the goals, tools, and workflows we use at The Carpentries. It is intended to ensure that everyone in the organisation is following a consistent approach to assessment. 

At The Carpentries we are “Always Learning”. We embody the growth mindset we teach using data and community feedback to measure our impact and foster continuous improvement. Gathering community feedback and data, analyzing and synthesizing that information, and drawing conclusions is the domain of assessment. 

#### 1.1 Purpose of this Handbook
- The reader should gain:
    -  an understanding of The Carpentries assessment philosophy 
    -  resources to conduct assessment (e.g., list and description of the tools we use, workflows, tips and tricks, etc.)
- You are not meant to read this cover to cover. It is more intended to serve as a reference.. 
### 1.2 Assessment Fundamentals 
#### 1.2.1 What is Assessment? 
* Assessment, in the context of educational and organisational settings, refers to the systematic process of gathering, interpreting, and using information to understand and improve learning, performance, or organisational outcomes.
#### 1.2.2 Importance of Assessment
**Why It's Critical**
Assessment is the bridge between educational or organisational intentions and outcomes. It allows stakeholders to understand if they're on the right path to achieving their goals or if course corrections are necessary.

**Benefits**
* **Quality Improvement**: Regular assessment ensures that programs and initiatives maintain high standards and continue to meet the changing needs of their audience.
* **Accountability**: Assessment results demonstrate to stakeholders, including donors, participants, and team members, that an organisation is responsible and outcome-driven.
* **Informed Decision-making**: Real-time data from assessments empower leaders to make evidence-based decisions.
#### 1.2.3 Types of Assessments
* **Formative Assessment**: Ongoing assessment used to provide feedback and support during the learning or operational process. It informs adjustments in teaching strategies or organisational practices.
    * **Educational Example**: In a Carpentries workshop, instructors might use quick polls or quizzes halfway through a session to gauge learner understanding and adjust the pace or content accordingly.
    * **Organisational Example**: In a nonprofit's outreach campaign, feedback from an initial set of stakeholders can inform adjustments in messaging or strategy for subsequent phases.
* **Summative Assessment**: This evaluates learner or organisational achievement at the end of an instructional unit or project by comparing it against a benchmark or standard.
    * **Educational Example**: A post-workshop survey at The Carpentries that measures participants' overall understanding and satisfaction.
    * **Organisational Example**: At the end of a fiscal year, a non-profit might assess the overall success of a fundraising campaign by comparing the funds raised against its set target.

#### 1.2.4 Key Terminology 
* **Activity**: Work performed to implement programs or services to our community.
* **Impact**: the measurable or observable effects, changes, or outcomes that occur as a result of specific actions, initiatives, or interventions. Impact can be positive or negative, intended or unintended, and can vary in scale from individual to systemic levels.
* **Metric**: Quantifiable piece of information used to measure change over time.
* **Outcome**: A specific result a program is intended to achieve. 
* **Output**: Product or service that result from activities.
* **Target**: A clearly defined objective or planned result to be achived within a stated time, against which actual results can be compared.
* **Theory of Change**: A diagram that maps how our programmatic activities lead to change. It shows how the activities being conducted, the outputs produced, and the outcomes anticipated are all connected.

For a complete list of a assessment terms, please refer to the [assessment glossary](#carpentries-assessment-glossary). 

## Part 2: Planning and Strategy

### 2.1 Theories of Change 
#### 2.1.1 What is a Theory of Change?
A Theory of Change (ToC) is a comprehensive description of how and why a desired change is expected to happen. 

It states the activities, outcomes, and assumptions that connect an organisation's mission to its strategic goals. The ToC serves as a roadmap for both planning and assessment, helping organisations articulate the steps needed to achieve their objectives. 

#### 2.1.2 Importance in Assessment 
* **Planning**: A ToC provides a clear framework for developing metrics that measure an organisation's impact. It informs what kind of data should be collected, when, and how.
* **Alignment**: It ensures that everyone in the organisation is on the same page about what they are trying to achieve, the steps to get there, and how they'll know if they have. 
* **Accountability**: By mapping out outcomes and the paths to reach them, a ToC serves as an accountability tool. Teams can regularly check whether they are on course to achieve the intended outcomes and take corrective action if needed.
* **Communication**: A well-articulated ToC can be used to communicate with external stakeholders like funders, partners, or volunteers to transparently share the organisation's goals and methods. 

#### 2.1.3 Importance in Planning
* **Strategic Planning**: A ToC informs the strategic plan by providing a detailed roadmap of actions and outcomes, helping to prioritize activities.
* **Resource Allocation**: Knowing what activities lead to which outcomes helps in better allocation of resources like time, money, and person time.
* **Risk Assessment**: By listing assumptions and external factors, a ToC can help in identifying risks that might derail the project, allowing for better risk management.
* **Adaptability**: A ToC isn’t set in stone; it's a dynamic tool that should be updated regularly. This makes it invaluable for planning, as it can adapt to new insights, challenges, or opportunities that arise.

A Theory of Change is an essential tool for organisations aiming for systemic, long-term impact, allowing for more effective planning, execution, and assessment.

#### 2.1.4 How to Develop a Theory of Change
1. **Identify Clear Objectives**: Start by pinpointing the long-term goals you aim to achieve. These should align with your organisation's mission.
1. **Map Outcomes**: Identify the outcomes that need to occur to achieve these objectives. Break them down into short-term, intermediate, and long-term outcomes.
1. **Specify Inputs and Activities**: List the resources (inputs) and actions (activities) required to bring about these outcomes.
1. **Establish metrics**: Decide on measurable metrics for each outcome, which will help in future assessments.
1. **Identify Assumptions**: Note any assumptions that underlie your expectations and outcomes.
1. **Sequence the Steps**: Arrange all elements (inputs, activities, outcomes) in a logical order to show causality and flow.
1. **Visualize**: Create a visual representation (flowchart, diagram) to illustrate the Theory of Change.

#### 2.1.5 Best practices for making Theories of Change actionable and measurable
* **Alignment**: Align your ToC with the organisation's missions and strategic objectives.
* **SMART Goals**: Make sure all objectives and outcomes are Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound.
* **Accountability**: Assign responsibilities for each activity and outcome.
* **Review Periodically**: Make it a habit to review and update the Theory of Change, especially after key milestones or evaluations.
* **Documentation**: Keep thorough records of how decisions were made during the creation process for future reference and adaptation.

### 3.2 Data Interpretation
#### 3.2.1 How to Read Data 
**Introduction to interpreting raw data sets**

Raw data, though abundant, often lacks context; understanding its nuances requires systematic interpretation techniques.

Recognizing patterns, outliers, and anomalies is pivotal for accurate insights.

**Descriptive statistics for initial insights**

Descriptive statistics like the mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation offer a summarized view of the data's main features.

These metrics help discern the central tendencies, variability, and dispersion in a data set.

**Visual methods for data interpretation**

* Graphs: Line or bar graphs can reveal trends and fluctuations over time or across categories.
* Histograms: Helpful in visualizing the distribution of a dataset, especially to discern its skewness.

#### 3.2.2 Common Pitfalls 

**Frequent mistakes during data interpretation**

* Correlation vs. Causation: Just because two variables move in tandem doesn't mean one causes the other.
* Overfitting: Relying too heavily on your current dataset, without ensuring the model's general applicability.
* Ignoring Outliers: Disregarding anomalies can skew results.

**Implications of these pitfalls**

Misinterpretations can lead to flawed decisions, strategies, or policies, potentially causing financial or reputational harm.

Mistakes, once recognized, can undermine trust in data analytics.

### 3.3 Reporting Results 
#### 3.3.1 Best practices for data presentation

Use a combination of text, tables, and visuals to convey findings.
Opt for clarity over complexity; intricate charts or jargon-heavy text can confuse rather than clarify.
#### 3.3.2 Clarity and Conciseness

Results should be articulated in simple, straightforward language, avoiding ambiguities.
Visuals should be self-explanatory, or accompanied by succinct legends or captions.
#### 3.3.3 Tailoring reports for different audiences

Internal Teams: Might appreciate more detail and technical jargon as they're familiar with the project's intricacies.
External Stakeholders: Often prefer summaries, with a focus on results, implications, and actionable insights.
#### 3.3.4 Creating Reports 
**Report Look and Feel**
Keep in mind [Carpentries Brand Identity](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/communications/resources/brand_identity.html), especially colors and fonts. 

**Report Structure**
Reports should follow a structured format to ensure clarity and easy comprehension.

Common structure: 
* Introduction
* Methods
* Results
* Discussion
* Conclusion

Navigating the Structure

* Headings: Use distinct styles for headings and subheadings. This helps break the content and aids in scanning the document.
* Numbering: Use a clear numbering system, especially for large reports, so readers can refer to specific sections easily.
* Tables of Contents: Especially for lengthy reports, a clickable TOC can greatly improve navigability.
* The Executive Summary: A concise overview of the main findings and recommendations. Aimed at decision-makers who might not have the time to delve into the report's details.

**RMarkdown for Reporting**

RMarkdown integrates code, visuals, and text into a single document, making it an excellent tool for reproducible research and dynamic report generation.
**Steps:**
1. Install the rmarkdown package.
1. Within RStudio, select File > New File > R Markdown.
1. Choose your desired output format (HTML, PDF, Word).
1. Embed R code chunks where needed.
1. Knit the document to produce the report.

### 3.4 Data Visualisation
#### 3.4.1 Choosing the Right Visual

Consider the story you're trying to tell. For trends over time, line graphs are great. For comparing categories, bar graphs are often ideal.
Creating Visuals:

R: The ggplot2 package in R is a powerful tool for creating sophisticated visuals.
Other Tools: Google Sheets and Excel have built-in chart tools that are user-friendly for beginners.
#### 3.4.2 Labeling & Accessibility
