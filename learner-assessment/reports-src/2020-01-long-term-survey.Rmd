In the fourth quarter of 2019 The Carpentries collected feedback from community
members who took a Carpentries workshop within six months. Find more information
about this data collection period [on our
blog](https://carpentries.org/blog/2019/11/long-term-impact-survey/). We are
excited to release the results of our long-term survey, and invite community
members to use this data to champion The Carpentries far and near.

We released [our first long-term
survey results](https://datacarpentry.org/blog/2017/10/long-term-survey-results)
in October 2017. You can find [the report](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/blob/master/learner-assessment/archives/2017/reports/longtermreport_October2017.pdf) and [its source](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/blob/master/learner-assessment/archives/2017/code/longtermreport_October2017.rmd) in the [assessment GitHub repository](https://github.com/carpentries/assessment/blob/master/learner-assessment/).

The results included in this report only cover the data collected in 2019 (between November 1st, 2019 and January 2nd, 2020). This report includes the analysis of `r nrow(lt_data)` responses but most questions are optional and specific questions have less answers.

## Respondents Career Stage

The majority of long-term survey respondents are graduate students. "Other
academic staff" includes Librarians, Research Software Engineers, IT Staff, and
Government Research Staff.

## Potential Impact on Respondents

    .vars = vars(starts_with("impact_"), -ends_with("open")),
    ~ as.character(match(., c(

    ))
  ) %>%

  ) +
  labs(subtitle = "(1: Strongly disagree, 3: Neutral, 5: Strongly agree)")
```

plot_multi(
  lt_data,
  var = community_involvement
)
```

## Respondents Participating in Learning Activities

```{r other_activities, fig.height=8}
plot_multi(
  lt_data,
  var = other_activities
)
```

## Respondents Who Recommended a Carpentries Workshop

```{r has_recommended}
plot_single(
  lt_data,
  var = has_recommended
)
```

## Recommendation and Net Promoter Scores

```{r recommendation_score}
plot_single(
  lt_data,
  var = recommendation_score,
  label_levels = as.character(0:10)
)
```

```{r nps_score}
nps_score <- nps(lt_data)
```


```{r nps, fig.height = 1.5}
nps_plot(nps_score) +
  labs(
    title = "Net Promoter Score"
  )
```

The [Net Promoter Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Net_Promoter) (NPS) for
our workshops according to the long-term survey is `r nps_score`. The NPS varies
between -100 and +100. It is calculated by substracting the percentage of
respondents who are considered "Promoters" (rating of 9 or 10) and the
percentage of respondents who are considered "Detractors" (rating equal or below
6). A positive NPS is deemed good, a NPS above 50 is deemed excellent, and an
NPS above 70 is exceptional.


## Respondents' Gender Identity

Note: Gender identity responses apply to U.S. survey respondents only.

```{r demographics_gender}
plot_single(
  lt_data,
  var = demographics_gender,
  label_levels = rev(
    c(
      "Female",
      "Gender variant/non-conforming",
      "Male",
      "Prefer not to answer"
    )
  )
)
```

## Respondents' Racial/Ethnic Identity

Note: Racial/ethnic identity responses apply to U.S. survey respondents only.


```{r demographics_ethnicity, warning = FALSE}

ethnicity_short <- tibble::tribble(
  ~short, ~full_name,
  "American Indian or Alaska Native", "American Indian or Alaska Native(A person having origins in any of the original peoples of North and South America (including Central America), and who maintains a tribal affiliation or community attachment.)",

)
```
