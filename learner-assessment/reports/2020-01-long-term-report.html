<td align="left">Keyboarding (typing) is a much more limiting factor than is usually recognized</td>

<td align="left">Before taking software carpentry, I looked over the materials that the course would ostensibly cover. I saw a mixture of things I knew and things I’d like to learn more about (like advanced shell usage), and so I decided to enroll in the workshop. The workshop, however, was much more introductory than I had thought it was going to be. I acknowledge that the workshops are likely the most valuable to participants that are just beginning to develop their technical skills, though I felt disappointed when topics like code structure translated to “let’s learn what a function is.” The spectrum of technical skills valuable to the sciences is wide, and I think programs like Carpentries could expand their workshops to intermediate or advanced skill sets if they have the resources and view them as part of their mission. I want to make clear that I think it’s great that Carpentries offers the workshops that it does, and that I acknowledge that I’m likely in the minority of workshop attendees</td>

<td align="left">Yes, I have learned that it is for students familiar with programming and mathematics. The pedagogy is perfect for them, but for most other students its a fiasco</td>
